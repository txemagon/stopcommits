Remember to write your config files.

The file extensions of the code to be analyzed are supposed to be in a file source.ext at ~/.stopcommits but you can override this behavior through the command line option --extensions-file
Type one regular expression filter per line.
 
Make a deprecated.yaml file in your ./stopcommits dir like this:
Example:
****************************************
--- 
class 1: 
  components: 
    - component 1
    - component 2
  error: You should have not been using this class
class 2: 
  components: 
    - component 1
    - component 2
  error: This is class is deprecateed since yy-mm-dd
****************************************

The above file starts with the three dashes. Replace class X with your class name. 
Replace component X with a suggested replacement component.
components is a keyword (do not touch).
Finally, error refers to the error message that will be displayed.

In components.yaml (at the same dir) provide at least location and description for a given component. 
Use whatever extra fields you feel like in your yaml file.

Example:
****************************************
ClassMaker:
  location: /usr/bin/class_maker.java
  description: Class Factory that makes whatever

chunkyfactory:
  location: /usr/bin/chunky_factory.java
  description: Your description.
****************************************

The config.yaml file overrides the gem defaults. See checkpatch -h for further reference.

Comand line invocation example: ./checkpatch -r ~/lookup/lluvia/lluvia -t 1
